# Pitchlake Simulator

## Install packages

To install the modules go to the scripts directory and run the following
```
yarn
#or
npm install
#or
pnpm install
```
The original codebase uses [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) (2.6.4) to build and test the contracts. Be sure to setup [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) as well, to handle versioning.

To ensure you are setup, run the following command from the root of this directory and check the output matches:

```
‚ùØ scarb --version
scarb 2.6.4 (c4c7c0bac 2024-03-19)
cairo: 2.6.3 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.6.3)
sierra: 1.5.0
```
