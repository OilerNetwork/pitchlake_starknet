# unallocated atm_unallocated_pool -> at-the-money vault - 1 mln ETH
# A deployed 500k ETH -> receives 500k ATM_VLT tokens
# B deployed 500k ETH -> receives 500k ATM_VLT tokens
# withdraw / deposit - no limitations at any time

# snapshot moment (monthly) -> move unallocated pool (entirety) to allocation for the next month
# result: unallocated_pool: 0, oct_23_atm_collateral_pool: 1 mln ETH

# ^^^^^^^ what happens here is that all your ETH are moved to collateral pool (oct_23_atm_collateral_pool)

# then you immediately start auction
# OCT_23_ATM_AUCTION is the token representing
# an auction participating option
# (we mint options and at them to the auction)
# OCT_23_ATM is a written option (sold in the auction)
# auction starts and CL is 80 ETH per option
# payout is 1 ETH per GWei of difference between the settlement and strike
# max payout is cl - strike (100 - 20)
# (auction parameters are set based on historical volatility and averages)
# for each 1 ATM_VLT in the oct_23_atm_collateral_pool
# holders receive 1/80 OCT_23_ATM_AUCTION token 
# deposits / withdrawals (from the unallocated pool) are never stopped!
# -------------
# so 12500 OCT_23_ATM_AUCTION (1mln / 80) options are placed in the auction
# now say 10000 options sell (80% of options sell) at a premium of 3ETH each
# (batch auction resulting price is 3 ETH (premium))
# read about batch auctions to understand how 3 ETH can be achieved
# it means that 20% were not sold in the auction

# so each of OCT_23_ATM_AUCTION is converted into
#     0.8 of OCT_23_ATM (80% of options sold will be represented as tokens) and
#     0.8 * 3 ETH (VLT_ATM) (premium for every option sold - 80%)
#     0.2 * 80 ETH (VLT_ATM) (collateral for unsold 20% options becomes unlocked) and

# result:
# A: 400k/80 of OCT_23_ATM and 100k of VLT_ATM + 5k * 3 of VLT_ATM (15k VLT_ATM for the premium)
# B: 400k/80 of OCT_23_ATM and 100k of VLT_ATM + 5k * 3 of VLT_ATM (15k VLT_ATM for the premium)

# atm_unallocated_pool: 230k VLT_ATM
# A: 115k VLT_ATM
#   100k or returned collateral from unsold options
#   15k of premium collected from selling
#     (5k options for 3 ETH each)
# B: 115k VLT_ATM
# so the premium is available already and unless withdrawn
# it will be used for minting options the next month
