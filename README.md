## Running Tests

The original codebase uses [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) (2.6.4) to build and test the contracts. Be sure to setup [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) as well, to handle versioning.

To ensure you are setup, run the following command from the root of this directory and check the output matches:

```
‚ùØ scarb --version
scarb 2.6.4 (c4c7c0bac 2024-03-19)
cairo: 2.6.3 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.6.3)
sierra: 1.5.0
```

Once Scarb is setup, you can run the full test suite via:

```
scarb test
```

To run specific tests, use the -f (filter) flag, followed by the string to match for. You can supply the file name, or specifc test names. The following command will run all the tests in the `vault_option_round_tests.cairo` file.

```
scarb test -f vault_option_round_tests
```

This command will run all tests that containing `auction` in their name:

```
scarb test -f auction
```

## Crash Course

The crash course is intended to catch devs up to speed on the technical aspects of the protocol, as well as help pre-prompt/train any LLMs for Pitchlake. This crash course can be found [here](./DOCUMENTATION.md).
